                            Murthy<br>
                            Narayana Murthy is the co-founder of Infosys, a multinational corporation
                            that provides services pertaining to technology, engineering, consulting and
                            outsourcing. Mr. Murthy founded Infosys in 1981.
                            Narayana Murthy did not grow up with the most favourable circumstances
                            but that didnt hold him back from achieving phenomenal success.
                            In 1981, after quitting his job as a General Manager at Patni Computer
                            Systems in Pune, and borrowing Rs 10,000 from his wife, Murthy started
                            Infosys.
                            In a span of only four years, the company grew into a tech giant and
                            employed over 2 lakh people, while also making Bangalore the IT hub of
                            India.
                            Apart from his towering contributions to the Indian economy through his
                            company, Narayana Murthy also made significant benefactions to the IT
                            world. He is now recognised as “the father of the IT sector”.</div>

                            the world&#39;s largest steel and mining company by output. Since 2008, Mittal
                            was a member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs. He sits on the
                            World Steel Association’s exclusive committee.
                            Lakshmi Mittal first learned about business from his father, Mohan Lal
                            Mittal. After graduation, Mittal worked for the family firm for a while, and
                            then struck out on his own in 1976 when he founded a steel plant in
                            Indonesia. Calling his steel company Arcelor Mittal, he ran this business
                            successfully throughout the 1980s, and in 1995 Mittal made a full
                            separation of his own steel business from the family&#39;s corporate holdings in
                            India. Soon afterward, Mittal settled in London, where he still resides to this
                            day. Mittal, an accountants with a global vision and practically endless
                            determination to succeed, overcame obstacles and prevailed in
                            consolidating the extensively divided steel industry.  At 71 (2021) years of
                            age, Mittal could certainly be considered the Andrew Carnegie of the new
                            millennium.</div>

                            built an empire of $10bn.
                            Born in Bikaner, Rajasthan in a Marwari family in 1960, Damani’s father ran
                            a small business. His untimely death led him to start a small business of
                            ball bearings, despite having no practical knowledge of business and stock
                            market. He just scrutinized and reviewed the stock market in his initial days
                            and learned ample valuable lessons. He made a profit by trading and
                            investing in MNC companies and began investing in the stock market at the
                            age of 32.
                            Radha Kishan is inspired by a value investor named Chandra Kant
                            Sampat. He followed the strategy of value investing and long term investing
                            from Mr. Sampat. He used to purchase the stocks at a lower price, keep it
                            for longer periods and then sell it. He became the biggest individual
                            shareholder of HDFC in the year 1995.
                            Damani has exemplified that determination, passion, farsightedness,
                            confidence, and knowledge can beat all the qualifications of the world.</div>

                        <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Deep Kalra obtained his bachelor’s degree from St. Stephen’s College,
                            Delhi and his Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) degree
                            from IIM Ahmedabad.
                            He went on to work for companies like ABN AMRO Bank, GE Capital, At
                            GE Money etc. Three years at the bank, Deep Kalra took a huge risk by
                            quitting the good paying and stable job at ABN Bank and deciding to turn
                            an entrepreneur. He brought the AMF Bowling – an American company
                            that was hoping to enter the Indian market to start the 10-pin bowling
                            revolution in the country. However, the venture failed, and he went back to
                            a boring and regular private job. He thinks that failure in his case helped
                            him a lot to keep going. Hence, with a backing of e-Ventures and along
                            with co-founders, Deep began his new Entrepreneurial journey with an
                            online travel company, MakeMyTrip after realizing the possibilities of the
                            internet. MakeMyTrip is now the largest Indian online travel company which
                            provides online travel services like hotel reservations, Air tickets, domestic
                            and international holiday packages, Cab Booking, train booking and bus

                        <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Hari Menon was born in 1996 in Bandra West, Mumbai into a middle-class
                            family. Hari is the CEO and Co-Founder of BigBasket, India’s largest
                            supermarket. He is also a Founder of Symphony Industrial AI. Before
                            founding Big Basket, Hari served as the CEO for various companies
                            including Tumri, Serus Corporation, and Timeli.
                            In 1999, Hari along with five of his friends, the founding team of BigBasket
                            had cofounded Fabmart, an online platform, which performed the same
                            functions that Amazon, Flipkart does today and was one of the pioneers in
                            e-commerce in India.
                            During the first year of his online platform, there were no transactions but
                            only noise, as it could not generate enough revenue.
                            After the failure of Fabmart they launched Fabmall, a physical version of
                            Fabmart and India’s first integrated online-to-offline retail company, a
                            venture which took off. Around the same time, Hari Menon decided to sell-
                            off the business to Aditya Birla Group. After the success of Fabmart, Hari
                            Menon, Vipul Parekh, V S Sudhakar, Abhinay Choudhari, and V S Ramesh
                            founded Bigbasket in October 2011.
                            Hari Menon is one of those Indian entrepreneurs, who struggle a lot in their
                            initial life, entrepreneurial journey, and then step onto the market with a
                            unique business idea and get success by his pivotal efforts.</div>

                            Microsoft. In 1980, Premji seized the opportunity to transform Wipro into an

                            In 2010, he was voted among the 20 most powerful men in the world
                            by Asiaweek. He has twice been listed among the 100 most influential
