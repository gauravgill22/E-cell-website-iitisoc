               <strong>In Japan in 1917, a 23-year-old apprentice at the Osaka Electric Light Company with no formal education came up with an improved light socket. His boss wasn’t interested so young Matsushita started making samples in his basement. He later expanded with battery-powered bicycle lamps and other electronic products. Matsushita Electric, as it was known until 2008 when the company officially changed its name to Panasonic, is now worth $66 billion. </strong> 
               <br><br> Full story: <br>
               Konosuke Matsushita was born on November 27, 1894 in Wasamura, a farming village. His father was a small landowner and prominent member of the community, and Konosuke, the youngest of eight children, enjoyed a comfortable early childhood. But the family's fortunes turned when his father lost his property as a result of poor speculation on the commodities market, and the family was forced to leave their farm and move to a small house in the city.
             <br>

             To help support the family, Konosuke was apprenticed to a hibachi (charcoal brazier) store in Osaka a few months before he was to graduate from elementary school.

             <br>
             He used to get up everyday, before sunrise. Clean the store, run errands & and than look after the children of his employer.
               <br> Some years later, Destiny showed him a new path.
                <br><br>He got a job in electricity company. There he got interested in light bulbs and sockets. Every night, he started learning and experimenting on his own.One day, he made a improved version of a light socket, all by himself. He got very excited and showed to his boss. But his boss was not impressed and said such a product will not work. Even though he was rejected, he believed in his idea.
                <br><br> He wanted do something on his own, start His own company. He asked his friends and they told him he cannot do it. He cannot not leave his permanent job and start his own company. He has no experience, very little money and hardly any education.
                <br>Still, he believed in himself.
               <br>So when he turned 22, he took a big decision. He left his stable job and started his own small manufacturing company. He and his wife, started manufacturing sockets in their small house. They both went door to door to selling them. But no shop owner was interested, they didn't get any order. Months passed by, and he still were not able to sell their product. He sold his furniture, borrowed money, to survive a little longer. Many days, he thought he will give up and get back to his job. Then came a time, he was almost a bankrupt and just when he was closest to giving up his dream.
               <br><br>That's when a miracle, happened in his life. Out of nowhere he got his first major order of 1000 pieces.  <br>
               Now 100 years after that first major order of 1000 pieces. His company now has, 250,000 employees, with annual sales of $65billion. His company products now sold over across the world.
               <br>All this was made possible by a man, with no education and no money.
               All he had was a firm belief in himself.
