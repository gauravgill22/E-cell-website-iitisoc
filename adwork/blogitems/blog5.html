               <strong>What is Creativity in business?</strong> 
               <br>Creativity in business is a way of thinking that inspires, challenges, and helps people to find innovative solutions and create opportunities out of problems. It's the reason some companies wow us with new, amazing ideas, whilst others merely follow the beaten path. It's the source of innovation and inspiration.
               <br><br><strong>What is innovation in business?
            </strong> <br>
               <br>Business innovation is when companies implement new processes, ideas, services, or products with the goal of boosting the bottom line. It could mean launching new and improved products or services (which can lead to higher revenue), making an existing process more efficient, or solving a current business problem (both of which cut down on costs and save time). A business focus on brainstorming, design thinking, or the establishment of an innovation lab can drive business innovations. The key element of innovation is that it drives revenue for the company. 

               <br> <br><strong>Creativity vs. Innovation</strong><br>
               The main difference between creativity and innovation is the focus. Creativity is about unleashing the potential of the mind to conceive new ideas. Those concepts could manifest themselves in any number of ways, but most often, they become something we can see, hear, smell, touch, or taste. However, creative ideas can also be thought experiments within one person’s mind.

             <br>

             Creativity is subjective, making it hard to measure, as our creative friends assert.

             <br>
             Innovation, on the other hand, is completely measurable. Innovation is about introducing change into relatively stable systems. It’s also concerned with the work required to make an idea viable. By identifying an unrecognized and unmet need, an organization can use innovation to apply its creative resources to design an appropriate solution and reap a return on its investment.

               <br>Organizations often chase creativity, but what they really need to pursue is innovation. Theodore Levitt puts it best: “What is often lacking is not creativity in the idea-creating sense but innovation in the action-producing sense, i.e. putting ideas to work.”
