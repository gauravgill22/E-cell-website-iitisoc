               <strong> Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy</strong>  (born 20 August 1946) is an Indian billionaire businessman. He is the founder of Infosys, and has been the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief mentor of the company before retiring and taking the title chairman emeritus.<br>
Time Magazine has described Murthy as the “father of the IT sector”. Even Fortune Magazine listed him among 12 greatest entrepreneurs of our time. Padma Sri and Padma Vibhushan awards have honoured him.<br>
<br>
<strong>before founding Infosys</strong> <br>
Murthy was born and raised in Shidlaghatta, Karnataka. He graduated from National Institute of Engineering, University of Mysore with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He received his master's degree from IIT Kanpur and post that he started working at IIM Ahmedabad as the chief systems programmer. There he worked on India's first time-sharing computer system and designed and implemented a BASIC interpreter for Electronics Corporation of India Limited. However, after a short stint, he moved to entrepreneurship with his first company - Softronics. 

When that company failed after about a year and a half, he joined Patni Computer Systems in Pune. 

<br>However, soon after, Murthy decided to quit his 9-to5 job and embark on his entrepreneurial journey in the IT sector. It was a brave choice for him at the time.


<br>
<strong> of Infosys </strong><br>
A bitter experience on a train in 1974 in Niš, a border town between what is now Serbia and Bulgaria, turned N R Narayana Murthy into a "compassionate capitalist" from a "confused leftist", leading him to create Infosys. Murthy and his six software professionals founded Infosys in 1981 with an initial capital investment of Rs 10,000, which was provided by his wife Sudha Murthy.

In a span of only four years, the company grew into a tech giant and employed over 2 lakh people, while also making Bangalore the IT hub of India. Not only did Murthy taste sweet success with Infosys, he also created an array of jobs for IT graduates. Little did he know, that his company would go on to become India's second-largest IT company of all time. The company's annual earnings of Rs 21,539 Cr in the past year (according to Economic Times) are a key indicator of its dominance in the IT sector around the world.

<br> <strong> Infosys foundation </strong><br>
It's easy to get blown away by the power of money, especially when you have a mammoth net worth of Rs 17,084 Cr. However, the modest and humble Narayana Murthy always believed in uplifting others along the way. And, when it comes to matters of philanthropy, the Infosys Foundation - the philanthropic arm of Infosys - excels in similarity to their business growth. His wife Sudha Murthy has also occupied the role of the chairperson at this philanthropic venture.
For his supreme efforts in the IT sector and priceless contributions to India’s economic growth, Narayana Murthy has been awarded the Padma Shri Award (2000) and the Padma Vibhushan Award (2008). </p>
