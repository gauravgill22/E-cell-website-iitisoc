        <a class="close" href="#stepbystep">&times;</a>
        <div class="content">
            While developing a product, you need to prioritize your development. There are some features that you customers feel is more important to develop then other features. Making a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in such a case makes more sense. MVP is the product that has a core feature for a limited group of people - your initial base of customers. MVP can be used in two ways: MVP is the first shippable product that is delivered to the customers. It is a way to gauge how the product can be received in the market. Give example.
MVP can also help validate the existence of demand for a product. It helps create interest for a particular product before the final product is ready to be published. MVP here is used as a risk mitigator. Example. Every startup is based on two hypothesis: The Value assumption and growth hypothesis. Every startup wants to validate their growth and value hypothesis as soon as possible. MVP can one of the effective ways to test their growth and value hypothesis. Before making your MVP, you need to define a clear definition of the what your target audience is and what problem you are solving. You should design your product such that it can be scaled up. Try making your product innovative so that your sales team have a very good value proposition to sell. You need to define the flow in which you want your customers to go through the product. You need to list down all the stages and features that you want to have in your product. You need to prioritize them. Make sure all the MVP are tested by the customer and the feedbacks are incorporated into the product.
The best way to test your Minimal Viable Product is by conducting interviews. Monitor your social media account. It is a very good way to gauche market willingness for a product.
We can also perform A/B Split testing . If a customer doesn’t like a particular product company needs to get to bottom of the problem . There might be only some features which the customers doesn’t like, we can test that by isolating that feature. MVPs can be of various types.
1)Wireframes - Wireframes are skeletal frames of your future projects.. They can be screen layout, element arrangement and navigation system.
2)Mockups - Mockups are ready made design which may or will integrated into the product in the future.They can be made interactive by using various softwares such as invisionapp, proto.io, etc.
3)Explainer Videos - explainer video is a video which explains the complete product to the normal audience.
4)Landing Page - If you want a software, but don’t have the money to make it fully functionally, Then people can look at the website and give the company feedback regarding to website.
Software prototype - Develop of incomplete version of the product which contains only basic and core features which may be launched and then taken feedback from initial customers.
